# Kerbal Space Program Space Shuttle Ascent Guidance

My KSP ascent guidance script for the Space Shuttle which uses UPFG, adapted and modified to perform aborts.

# Remarks

This script was last tested in KSP 1.9 with a full RO install. If you use a different version of KSP or the mods there may be different configuration parameters that throw the whole thing off-balance.
In addition, my adaptations are very iffy, i.e. constructed from some idea that I had which happened to work by some miracle.
I provide these scripts as they are, with no guarantee that they'll work perfectly every time. **YMMV**

# Installation

**Required mods:**
- A complete install of RSS/Realism Overhaul with Ferram Aerospace Resarch. Confrmed to work with FAR 0.16.0.1, should now also work with 0.16.0.4
- Kerbal Operating System
- DECQ's Space Shuttle System mod, this fork seems to be the most up-to-date : https://github.com/DylanSemrau/Space-Shuttle-System
- RO configs that come with the Realism Overhaul package
- **My Shuttle entry script https://github.com/giuliodondi/kOS-ShuttleEntrySim required by RTLS and TAL aborts**

**CAVEAT** 
I'm aware that there is a more up-to-date Shuttle version made by SpaceODY, I never tested my scripts with his version, there may be different part configurations so, once again, **YMMV**
